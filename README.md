## Introduction

Polybuild POC is designed for developers who face challenges with traditional build systems. The framework offers:

- **Deterministic Build Workflows**: Ensures consistent build outputs.
- **Component Isolation Protocols**: Separates components to prevent interference.
- **Governance-Driven Architecture Management**: Maintains control over the build process.

This repository aims to streamline your build process, making it faster and more reliable.

## Features

- **Single-Pass Compilation**: Avoids the need for multiple passes, saving time and resources.
- **Cost-Based Dependency Resolution**: Analyzes dependencies to optimize the build order.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhances build speed and efficiency.
- **Distributed Builds**: Supports building across multiple machines.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Scalable for large projects and teams.

## Installation

To get started with Polybuild POC, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mark12355433020/polybuild-poc.git
   cd polybuild-poc
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have the necessary tools installed. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   Execute the build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

To use Polybuild POC effectively, follow these guidelines:

1. **Define Your Components**: Create a configuration file that outlines your project structure and components.

2. **Configure Dependencies**: Specify dependencies in your configuration file. Polybuild will handle the rest.

3. **Execute the Build**: Use the command line to trigger the build process.

4. **Monitor Build Progress**: Keep an eye on the logs for real-time updates.

5. **Review Outputs**: Check the output directory for your built components.

## Architecture

Polybuild POC is built on a robust architecture that supports scalability and efficiency. Here are the key components:

- **Core Engine**: Manages the build process and executes tasks.
- **Dependency Resolver**: Analyzes and resolves dependencies using cost functions.
- **Component Manager**: Handles component isolation and governance.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple command-line interface for interaction.

### Component Isolation Protocols

To ensure that components do not interfere with each other, Polybuild implements strict isolation protocols. This feature is crucial for large projects where different teams work on various components.

### Cost-Based Dependency Resolution

Polybuild uses advanced algorithms to determine the most efficient build order based on cost functions. This approach minimizes build time and maximizes resource utilization.
